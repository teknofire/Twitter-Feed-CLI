Twitter Feed CLI

This is just a quick and dirty cli tool for showing a twitter feed from a specific search param.

Currently it starts with a 5 second delay and which increases by 5 seconds each time a search is done and no results are found up to a max of 60 seconds.

Usage
-----
./twits.rb <search term>

Search term can be any string, including the standard twitter # and @ keywords

Requirements
------------

ruby
rubygems
gems: term-ansicolor, twitter, htmlentities


TODO
----

Expose some options for modifying the delay between checks.
